          'Most agile development methods break product development work into small increments that minimize the amount of up-front planning and design. Iterations, or sprints, are short time frames (timeboxes) that typically last from one to four weeks. Each iteration involves a cross-functional team working in all functions: planning, analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing. At the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders. This minimizes overall risk and allows the product to adapt to changes quickly. An iteration might not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release (with minimal bugs) at the end of each iteration. Through incremental development products have room to "fail often and early" throughout each iterative phase instead of drastically on a final release date. Multiple iterations might be required to release a product or new features. Working software is the primary measure of progress.',

The process ensures that the design match the needs and capabilities of the people for whom they are intended. What are their needs? More importantly, what are the behaviors motivating those needs? By taking a human-centered design approach, we’re able to better meet and anticipate people’s expectations as they interact with your business and products. The human centered design process goes through four key activities - Observation, Idea generation, Prototyping, and Testing. These four activities are iterated - they repeated over and over, with each cycle yielding more insights and getting closer to the desired solution. This allows us to really understand the people you’re trying to reach and how to successfully engage them with your product or service. From there, we use our findings to guide how we design in a way that solves the problem and meets people’s needs in the simplest way possible.',
